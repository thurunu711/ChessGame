/**
 * {@code @BeforeSuite} is used to signal that the annotated method should be
 * executed <em>before</em> <strong>all</strong> tests in the current test suite.
 *
 * <h2>Method Signatures</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeSuite} methods must have a {@code void} return type, must
 * be {@code static} and must not be {@code private}.
 *
 * <h2>Inheritance and Execution Order</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeSuite} methods are inherited from superclasses as long as they
 * are not <em>overridden</em> according to the visibility rules of the Java
 * language. Furthermore, {@code @BeforeSuite} methods from superclasses will be
 * executed before {@code @BeforeSuite} methods in subclasses.
 *
 * <p>The JUnit Platform Suite Engine does not guarantee the execution order of
 * multiple {@code @BeforeSuite} methods that are declared within a single test
 * class or test interface. While it may at times appear that these methods are
 * invoked in alphabetical order, they are in fact sorted using an algorithm
 * that is deterministic but intentionally non-obvious.
 *
 * <p>In addition, {@code @BeforeSuite} methods are in no way linked to
 * {@code @AfterSuite} methods. Consequently, there are no guarantees with regard
 * to their <em>wrapping</em> behavior. For example, given two
 * {@code @BeforeSuite} methods {@code createA()} and {@code createB()} as well as
 * two {@code @AfterSuite} methods {@code destroyA()} and {@code destroyB()}, the
 * order in which the {@code @BeforeSuite} methods are executed (e.g.
 * {@code createA()} before {@code createB()}) does not imply any order for the
 * seemingly corresponding {@code @AfterSuite} methods. In other words,
 * {@code destroyA()} might be called before <em>or</em> after
 * {@code destroyB()}. The JUnit Team therefore recommends that developers
 * declare at most one {@code @BeforeSuite} method and at most one
 * {@code @AfterSuite} method per test class or test interface unless there are no
 * dependencies between the {@code @BeforeSuite} methods or between the
 * {@code @AfterSuite} methods.
 *
 * <h2>Composition</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @BeforeSuite} may be used as a meta-annotation in order to create
 * a custom <em>composed annotation</em> that inherits the semantics of
 * {@code @BeforeSuite}.
